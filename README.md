pdf-converter
============

This is an edited version, of the pdfminer project. Unlike the pdfminer project, this automatically writes to a text file.

To use this just put the path to the pdf file in pdf.txt, and then run pdf2txt.py, and also make sure you create a seprate folder and put nothing there except
for this repository.

Here is a link to an example pdf, http://www.mediafire.com/download/9fr6y3k0wqy0a1n/test.pdf.
